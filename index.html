         <h2>About Me (boring!)</h2>
         <h3>Who?</h3>
         <p>I am a curious creature with an artist's disposition.  Love saved me from conceit and (eventually) taught me gratitude.  I'm not especially ambitious, but I <em>would</em> very much like, one day, to shine as brightly as those who've guided me in my life.  Despite all that, I <strong>still</strong> somehow frequently struggle to connect with other people on a personal level.  Go figure.  No doubt, there's some superficial--but persistent!--idiosyncrasy in my unconscious protocol for percieving and analyzing my experiences and the world, more broadly, underlying this flummoxing obscurity.  Never mind that, though; it's nothing new (and, perhaps, a bit too wordy).  Indeed, you've met me before in one flavor or another; so, don't be fooled into thinking that I'm someone unfamiliar--no matter how hard I may try to trick you!</p>
         <h3>What?</h3>
         <p>Yeah, I might not've paid any attention either.  Anyways, I've been known to teach: mostly math (calculus, <em>engineering</em> differential equations, linear algebra, and middle/high-school topics) and music (piano, guitar, drums, and music-theory).  I've also played music semi-professionally, including as a founding member of <a href="https://vctheband.bandcamp.com/album/fusion-for-a-reason">Vehicle Collector</a>, and professionally, including as a founding member of <a href="https://smacktalk.bandcamp.com/album/domestication">Smacktalk</a> and as an occasional session player for <a href="https://www.souljetrecords.com/">Ethan Thompson</a> and <a href="https://www.henrylavallee.com/">Henry Lavallee</a>.  Otherwise, you're most likely to find me doing math, playing my piano, or tinkering on my computer.</p>
         <h3>When?</h3>
         <p>1997, onwards: 24/7, baby! (PST)</p>
         <h3>Where?</h3>
         <p>Probably <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mercer+Island,+WA+98040/">Mercer Island, WA</a>.  Also, (frequently) <a href="https://discord.gg/Z4DSX5QcxN">Discord</a> and (rarely) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanchezcalexander">Facebook</a>.
         <h3>Why?</h3>
         <p>Good question... Camus described an <em>invincible summer</em>, Buddha spoke of <em>nirvana</em>, and Nirvana sang about (teen) <em>spirit</em>.  Kidding aside, there is a certain visceral feeling, similar to focus or drive, which seems to be most saliently experienced by almost everybody (at least initially) in a fleeting kind of way while being pulled away from something meaningful by something measurably less meaningful.  This feeling is stripped of its ostensibly intrinsically transient nature--it is distilled, foritified, and elaborated--by exercising deliberate, controlled experiential dissociation.  For Buddha, this was meditation--a relatively pure and direct approach, to be sure.  Writing took that role for Camus.  Likewise for many of the great <em>X</em>ers and <em>Y</em>ists, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> functioned so.  In fact, the thing is not actually important.  What <strong>is</strong> important is the realization that this feeling is not really <em>about</em> any one thing in particular: it is the emotional essence of I'd like to call "meaning," and can be cultivated independently of life-circumstance.  An ember inside each of us, it requires only oxygen, sustinance, and shelter to eventually burn brightly.  "Why," you ask?  So that my fire may flourish.</p>
